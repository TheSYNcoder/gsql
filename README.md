# GSQL

 Using gsheets through the browser, you should be ashamed of yourself as a developer.
 Use the power of GSQL to use gsheets like never before!



### Development

This project uses ``black`` to format code and ``flake8`` for linting. We also support ``pre-commit`` to ensure
these have been run. To configure your local environment please install these development dependencies and set up
the commit hooks.

```bash

   $ pip install black flake8 pre-commit
   $ pre-commit install

```

Install further dependencies using

```
    $ pip install requirements.txt    
```
