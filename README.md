You should be ashamed of yourself as a developer by using google sheets through the browser.
Use the power of GSQL to use gsheets like never before!

### Development

This project uses ``black`` to format code and ``flake8`` for linting. We also support ``pre-commit`` to ensure
these have been run. To configure your local environment please install these development dependencies and set up
the commit hooks.

```bash

   $ pip install black flake8 pre-commit
   $ pre-commit install

```

Install further dependencies using

```
    $ pip install requirements.txt    
```

Before making a pull request

```
$ pre-commit run --all-files
$ pytest

```
All tests should pass
